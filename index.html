          <p>We try to make our launcher as clean and smooth as possible by having a nice dark background with splashes of blue and white here and there. We have a simple UI that is not too hard to use but has many features, to compare with Minecraft Java Clients. We have a fast, and swift team that can easily come to you through our Discord page or by listing an issue on Github! We are happy to here your feedback support. We want the best user experience possible. One more thing, this is completely free.</p>

We understand that, and that is why we have created a Discord Server for our members. We have a ticketing system to help our members figure out how to use our client an teaches them how to configure it properly. In these tickets, people can give feedback too.</p>
